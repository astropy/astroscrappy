 * This file contains image utility functions for SCRAPPY. These are the most
 * computationally expensive pieces of the calculation so they have been ported
 * to C.
 *
 * Many thanks to Nicolas Devillard who wrote the optimized methods for finding
 * the median and placed them in the public domain. I have noted in the
 * comments places that use Nicolas Devillard's code.
 *
 * Parallelization has been achieved using OpenMP. Using a compiler that does
 * not support OpenMP, e.g. clang currently, the code should still compile and
 * run serially without issue. I have tried to be explicit as possible about
 * specifying which variables are private and which should be shared, although
 * we never actually have any shared variables. We use firstprivate instead.
 * This does mean that it is important that we never have two threads write to
 * the same memory position at the same time.
 *
 * All calculations are done with 32 bit floats to keep the memory footprint
 * small.
